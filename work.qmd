I help researchers and teams move from **question → design → implementation → decision**.

## Typical engagements
### Causal strategy
- Define the causal question, estimand, and identification strategy
- DAG review + assumptions audit
- Sensitivity analysis plan (what could break the conclusion?)

### Research engineering
- Reproducible pipelines (data → features → models → report)
- Versioned outputs + clean project structure
- Lightweight dashboards for exploration (e.g., Streamlit)

### Model review
- Check leakage, overfitting, and evaluation design
- Interpretability and robustness checks
- “Is this decision justified?” style review

## What I don’t do
- Black-box modeling without a decision context
- Overconfident claims when assumptions are weak
