## How I approach claims
- **Make assumptions explicit.** If a conclusion depends on an assumption, it should be visible.
- **Prefer designs over algorithms.** Strong identification beats fancy models.
- **Show sensitivity.** If small changes flip results, that’s a result.
- **Reproducibility by default.** Clean structure, pinned dependencies, and runnable outputs.

## What “trustworthy” means here
- Clear scope: what a method can and cannot answer
- Sources when factual claims matter
- Honest uncertainty when evidence is thin
