## Beyond Correlations and Regressions

Traditional data science often stops at correlations, p-values, and associative models. Causalica is about taking the next step: understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive outcomes. 

We leverage cutting-edge tools for **causal inference**—moving from "what happened" to "why it happened" and "what if we change this?"

## The Causalica Approach

Our work focuses on three pillars:

1.  **Structural Causal Models (SCMs):** We build explicit frameworks to map out causal assumptions, moving beyond the limitations of simple regressions to capture the complexity of real-world systems.
2.  **AI-Enhanced Discovery:** We use AI not just for prediction, but as a lever to scale causal discovery and automate the identification of potential causal links in high-dimensional data.
3.  **Decision-Centric Workflows:** Causal inference isn't just a theoretical exercise. Our goal is to aid decision-making by providing robust estimates of treatment effects and counterfactual scenarios.

## What You'll Find Here

-   **Research-Grade Workflows:** Practical implementations of causal techniques (Double ML, Synthetic Control, IV, etc.) applied to real-world problems.
-   **A Living Textbook:** My ongoing journey to document the theory and practice of causal inference in a digestible, AI-ready format.
-   **Practical Notes:** Snippets, mental models, and hands-on tutorials for practitioners who want to move beyond p-hacking to principled decision science.

*Causalica is a space for those who want to build the future of decision-making, one cause at a time.*
